# Virtual Power Plant Orchestrator — Extended Edition

> **OpenEnv environment** — an AI agent manages 100 home batteries in a simulated neighbourhood to maximise a **multi-objective Pareto score** across five difficulty tiers, incorporating battery degradation, carbon credits, P2P trading, demand-response auctions, and grid islanding emergencies.

---

## What's New (Extended Edition)

| Feature | Description | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Battery Degradation (SoH)** | Each cycle degrades capacity by 0.001 per full cycle; SoH floors at 80% | New temporal objective: earn money without killing batteries |
| **Carbon Credits Subsystem** | Solar earns 0.05 credits/kWh; grid purchase in high-emission hours costs 0.08 credits/kWh | Multi-objective grader: profit + carbon together |
| **Forecast Confidence Bands** | `forecast_price_uncertainty` and `forecast_solar_uncertainty` grow with horizon | Enables risk-averse agent behaviour |
| **Pareto Multi-objective Grader** | 5-vector score: profit (50%) + safety (20%) + carbon (15%) + degradation (10%) + DR (5%) | Matches real VPP operator objectives |
| **P2P Energy Trading** | Zone B solar surplus routes to Zone A at midpoint price via `p2p_export_rate` action | Demand-side control without grid involvement |
| **Demand Response Auction** | Every 6 steps, grid posts a bid (1.5–3.0× premium); agent commits via `accept_dr_bid` | Commitment under uncertainty — frontiers LLMs struggle with |
| **Grid Islanding Emergency** | New `islanding-emergency` task: grid disconnects steps 20–29, reconnects with 8× spike | Tests mid-episode strategy switching |
| **Load Deferral** | `defer_ev_charging` action delays Zone B EV load (must repay by step 40) | Demand-side flexibility |
| **Adversarial Weather** | Expert task: forecast says clear sky, but cloud event at step 24 drops solar 80% | Tests forecast robustness |
| **Reasoning Trace Scorer** | `POST /trace` stores agent reasoning; evaluated for coherence vs action taken | Supports research into explainable agents |

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

=======
```bash
# 1. Install
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/<your-username>/vpp-env
cd vpp-env
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Start the server
uvicorn server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7860

# 3. Run the rule-based baseline (no API key)
python baseline_inference.py --agent rule

<<<<<<< HEAD

```bash
# Start on port 8000
python -m server.app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Or with uvicorn directly
uvicorn server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# 4. Run the LLM agent
export API_BASE_URL=https://router.huggingface.co/v1
export MODEL_NAME=Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct
export HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx_or_api_key
python inference.py
```

## Required Environment Variables

The evaluator expects these variables to be configured in your runtime environment:

- `API_BASE_URL` — API endpoint used by the OpenAI-compatible client
- `MODEL_NAME` — model identifier used for inference
- `HF_TOKEN` — Hugging Face token (or compatible API key)
- `LOCAL_IMAGE_NAME` — optional, only if your workflow uses `from_docker_image()`

Defaults in `inference.py` are set only for:

- `API_BASE_URL`
- `MODEL_NAME`

`HF_TOKEN` has no default and must be provided in deployment/runtime config.

The submission script is `inference.py` at project root and uses the OpenAI Python client interface for all LLM calls.

## Inference Output Contract

`inference.py` emits structured stdout in strict evaluator format:

- `[START] task=<task_name> env=vpp model=<model_name>`
- `[STEP] step=<n> action=<json> reward=<0.00> done=<true|false> error=<msg|null>`
- `[END] success=<true|false> steps=<n> score=<score> rewards=<r1,r2,...,rn>`

Only those lines are printed to stdout. Diagnostics are written to stderr.

## Reasoning Trace Scoring

Submit reasoning alongside an action via `POST /trace`:

  -d '{"global_charge_rate": -0.7, "min_reserve_pct": 0.2}'

For Hugging Face Spaces, set runtime variables (`API_BASE_URL`, `MODEL_NAME`, `HF_TOKEN`) in Space settings and tag the Space with `openenv`.

Curriculum:
1. **Easy** (200k steps) — learn basic arbitrage
2. **Medium** (150k steps) — heatwave + demand spikes
3. **Hard** (150k steps) — spike planning + frequency response
4. **Expert** (150k steps) — DR auctions + P2P + adversarial weather
5. **Islanding** (100k steps) — strategy switching, islanding survival

For Hugging Face Spaces, set runtime variables (`API_BASE_URL`, `MODEL_NAME`, `HF_TOKEN`) in Space settings and tag the Space with `openenv`.

Curriculum:
1. **Easy** (200k steps) — learn basic arbitrage
2. **Medium** (150k steps) — heatwave + demand spikes
3. **Hard** (150k steps) — spike planning + frequency response
4. **Expert** (150k steps) — DR auctions + P2P + adversarial weather
5. **Islanding** (100k steps) — strategy switching, islanding survival
